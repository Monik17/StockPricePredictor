This project focuses on predicting stock prices using deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. LSTM models are highly effective in capturing temporal dependencies in time-series data, making them ideal for financial forecasting.

## ðŸ§  Overview

The notebook demonstrates:
- Data loading and preprocessing of stock prices.
- Normalization of historical data for training.
- Design and training of a Sequential LSTM model using Keras.
- Evaluation of model performance.
- Visualization of predictions vs actual stock prices.
